## Welcome to the Generated Text Project: BPerez Edition

I was tasked with creating a generated text novel comprised of multiple texts. In the end, my creation is a combination of Greek Mythology and Beginner's American History.

### The Project Idea

During initial brainstorming and beginning the project, I wanted to create an Alchemy generated book but I was not happy with the texts I found. I did not think they would properly mesh and had the correct content I wanted to randomly generate together.

I, instead, tried to think of something else I could do, and was drawn to the example the [Zach Walden](https://youtu.be/oeL1u7n2d2s?list=PLu8zaGaJFFioMnKLLO-3_rww8VqtTyonf) had in his example of "Marxist Recipes." Going through though, I could not fid something that called to me or intrigued me enough to combine with recipes.

Then, when doing to research for my graduate project which relates to the Greek Mythological figure Medusa, I was intrigued with the idea of placing the mythological figures within history-landing on American History. Due to the fact that within the myths the gods and goddesses interact and intervene on the "mortals" I thought I would just, in a way, create some new myths, placing the figures within American History. Although with the random generation it may fall into a more alternate timeline due to random generation most likely rearranging events, people, and timelines.

### The Process

**_Note: this project is still in progress so the text still needs more editing and I am still working on getting the code to generate when clicking on the first bullet under "The Project"_**

I find myself getting frustrated with the GPT-2 on Google Colab so intead I decided I wanted to rather combine Exercise 1- Markovify- with Exercise 3- Creating a HTML, in my case using Github.

So I found my texts, edited it down and
